# Password-Java
This program allows users to make a password which will be placed as the final string. Once the user runs it, it prompts the user to enter their password. If the user gets it incorrect, it will ask to try again. Access will be denied after 3 failed attempts. However, if you get it correct, it will display "welcome" to the user.
